## ABOUT THE APP :world_map:

Wander and Wonder is a group project made during the [Codaisseur Academy](https://github.com/Codaisseur). It’s a game developed to learn more about the location of all countries in the world, and to peak someone’s interest in geography in a fun way.

As a player of Wonder and Wander you can start three different kinds of games (this will be extended in the future). In the game a country name or flag will be given and the player has to click on the corresponding country on the map.
